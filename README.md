# splatnet2statink.py

A script that works to upload JSON data from the SplatNet 2 app 
("Nintendo Switch Online", for use with *Splatoon 2*) to 
[http://stat.ink/](http://stat.ink/), a site for visualizing and 
aggregating statistics from *Splatoon* and *Splatoon 2*.

## Working features
- [x] Lobby/Mode
- [x] Stage
- [x] Weapon
- [x] Result, final count/percent, turf inked
- [x] Kills, deaths, assists, specials
- [x] Rank + rank after, level + level after
- [x] Battle start & end times

## To implement
- [ ] Gear recognition
- [ ] Splatfest support
- [ ] Automating SplatNet cookie generation/acquisition + JSON download
- [ ] Support for non-en_NA regions

### Getting your SplatNet cookie (manual – this process will 
hopefully be automated in the future)

1. Install the Python 3 package `mitmproxy`. For me this is `pip3 
install mitmproxy` in Terminal.

2. Run `mitmweb`. Keep this browser tab open for later.

3. Find your computer's internal IP address (`ifconfig`/`ipconfig`, or 
on Mac, System Prefs > Network > Wi-Fi > Advanced… > TCP/IP > IPv4 
Address) and your phone's (on Android, Settings > About phone > Status > 
IP address).

4. (Android) Settings > Wi-Fi > Long press to Modify network. Set Proxy 
to Manual under Advanced options. For proxy hostname, enter your 
computer's internal IP from before and enter the port as 8080.  
(iOS) Follow [this 
guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/293676/how-to-configure-a-proxy-server-on-an-iphone-or-ipad/).

5. Go to [http://mitm.it/](http://mitm.it/) on your phone and 
download/install the certificate.

6. Open/log in to 
[SplatNet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znca&hl=en) 
on your phone. In the mitmweb tab that opened before, look for the line 
that says `https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/?lang=en-US`. Grab the 
`cookie` value (should be something like `iksm_session=xxxxx` where 
`xxxxx` is your cookie).

7. Navigate to 
[https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/home](https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/home) 
in your browser (shows a forbidden error for now). Use a cookie editor 
(such as 
[EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en) 
for Chrome) to edit the cookie/iksm_session cookie to be `xxxxx` from 
before. Refresh, and [ta-da](https://i.imgur.com/UUoxEJS.png)!

### Downloading the JSON

1. Save the webpage at 
[https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/api/results](https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/api/results) 
as a JSON file after following the steps above

### Getting your stat.ink API key

1. Viewable at [https://stat.ink/profile](https://stat.ink/profile) 
after [registering](https://stat.ink/register) and logging in
