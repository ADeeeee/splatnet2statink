# splatnet2statink.py

A script that uploads JSON data from the SplatNet 2 app ("Nintendo Switch Online," for use with *Splatoon 2*) to [http://stat.ink/](http://stat.ink/), a site for visualizing and aggregating statistics from *Splatoon* and *Splatoon 2*.

## Usage
```
$ python splatnet2statink.py [-M] [-i path/to/results.json] [-t] [-p]
```

The `-M` flag runs the script in realtime monitoring mode, uploading new battle results as you play games.

The `-i` flag allows users to specify the path to a JSON file to be used as input. Without this, the file is pulled from [https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/api/results](https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/api/results), given a valid cookie.

The `-t` flag sends the data to stat.ink as a dry run, without uploading, for testing/validation purposes.

The `-p` flag suppresses uploading the battle number as a private note.

## To implement
- [ ] Gear + ability recognition (waiting on stat.ink API v2)

## Setup instructions

Change the `API_KEY` variable at the top of `splatnet2statink.py` to your stat.ink API key. You can also change `USER_LANG` to match your game's language.

When you run the script for the first time, it will prompt you to log in to your Nintendo Account to obtain your `session_token`. You may need to try logging in a few times if it doesn't work the first time. If your login is rejected multiple times, the script will try an alternate method by giving you a URL and prompting you to log in to your Nintendo Account through a browser with that URL. If this occurs, open the provided URL, right click the "Use this account" button and copy the URL, and paste that URL into the console window.

After the script returns your `session_token`, put it into `SESSION_TOKEN`, and run the script again to generate a cookie. Put the cookie into `YOUR_COOKIE`.

Once both of those values are set, you will be able to run the script normally and upload battle results to stat.ink.

### Using SplatNet 2 from your browser

If you want to access SplatNet 2 from your [browser](https://i.imgur.com/UUoxEJS.png), navigate to [https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/home](https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/home) (it should show a forbidden error). Use a cookie editor (such as [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en) for Chrome) to edit the `iksm_session` cookie to be the same value as `YOUR_COOKIE` from before, and refresh. If you wish to download the results JSON detailing your past 50 battles, save the webpage at [https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/api/results](https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/api/results) as a JSON.

### Obtaining your stat.ink API key

Go to [https://stat.ink/profile](https://stat.ink/profile) after [registering](https://stat.ink/register) and logging in.
